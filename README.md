### What's The Weather Like?

We all know that the weather gets hotter as you become closer to the Equator. The analysis of weather data from all over the world proves this. 

I utilized CityPy (provides geo-coordinates of every city) and the OpenWeatherMap API to select over 500 random cities and perform weather checks on each city. I created scatter plots to illustrate how various weather factors (Humiduty, Temperature, Cloudiness, and Wind Speed) change depending on the city's latitude. 

You can find my written analysis of the weather data in the Jupyter Notebook file.
